*StarMap* is an easy-to-be-used mediator between the popular structural display program *ChimeraX* and the refinement program *Rosetta*.
*StarMap* provides a graphical interface within *ChimeraX* to control and execute *Rosetta*-based refinements. It includes options for symmetry,
local refinements, as well as independent map validation.

A series of analytical outputs, including precise magnification calibration (pixel size calibration) and Fourier shell correlations (FSC)
to assess the overall quality of the refinement and resolution (map versus model FSC) are being calculated.
Furthermore, per-residue Z-scores provide a fast guide to evaluate and improve local refinements as well as to identify flexible and
potentially functional sites in large macromolecular complexes.

# Software releases

The actual release is: **StarMap @@VERSION@@**

The *ChimeraX 1.4+ (Qt6)* version of the plugin will be available via the **ChimeraX Toolshed** in the near future.

Meanwhile you can install it from the **dist** folder of this site.
```
  chimerax -m pip install --user ChimeraX_StarMap-@@VERSION@@-py3-none-any.whl
```

Installations using *ChimeraX 1.3 (Qt5)* are available in the **dist/qt5** folder of this site.
It can be installed as described in the command above.

# Development notes

Here are some starting notes on how this tool is developed.

Since *StarMap* was mainly ported from *Chimera 1.x* to *ChimeraX 0.3* in 2017, 
some development things might not be as now described in the actual *ChimeraX* development guidelines.

First have a look at the file *dev_functions.source* for example development environment settings. 
These functions are compatible with *BASH* and *ZSH*.

The user interface is done with the *QtCreator* of Qt5 and the script **qt5_to_qt6.sh** will replace some code statements.

## Create a development environment

Edit the shell function *starmap_create_env* to fit to your needs and call the following statements in your terminal:
```
  source dev_functions.source
  starmap_create_env
```
Install and setup *Rosetta*.

## Set your development environment

Here we use the shell statements in the *starmap_dev_chimerax_centos9* function by calling the following statements in your terminal:
```
  source dev_functions.source
  starmap_dev_chimerax_centos9
```

## Use Makefile targets to develop and test StarMap

We work with *Makefile* targets to do tasks.
	
### Install and test your changes

```
  make bundle-install
```
will generate the documentation and install it directly into your user space of your development *ChimeraX* application for testing.

### Make an installable Python wheel file
```
  make wheeldist-qt5
```
will generate the documentation and make a installable Python wheel file for *ChimeraX 1.3*.

### Change the user interface

```
  make qtcreator
  make test_gui
```
will open *QtCreator* if you want to change the user interface.
The second test target will show the user interface as pop-up window as it would appear in *ChimeraX*.
