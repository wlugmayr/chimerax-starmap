# The ChimeraX StarMap Plugin

*StarMap* is an easy-to-be-used mediator between the popular structural display program *ChimeraX* and the refinement program *Rosetta*.
*StarMap* is integrated as a plugin into *ChimeraX* to control and execute external *Rosetta* based refinements: options for symmetry,
local refinements, and independent map validations are provided via a GUI and a series of analytical outputs,
including model/map-FSC as well as local FSC are being calculated.

# Current State

This repository provides currently only the submmission templates for the review and test.

The source code will be provided here soon and the plugin will be available over the **ChimeraX Toolshed** in the future.
