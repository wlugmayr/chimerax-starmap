Advanced Tab
============

This tab provides additional **optional** features for *Rosetta* to calculate the result models.

.. image:: _images/advanced_tab_symmetry.png


Symmetry
--------

This box requires a run of the external symmetry detection tool as provided in the :ref:`Symmetry <symmetry_tab>` tab.
The information in this section will be used during execution script generation.

* **Use SYMM file**:
  Enabling this check box will also enable *Rosetta* to use use the provided symmetry file.

* **HELIX**:
  Enable this check box if helical symmetry is used.
  It will **not** add the flag **-score_symm_complex** to the *Rosetta* execution as done for normal symmetry.

* **Select**:
  When the symmetry detection in the :ref:`Symmetry <symmetry_tab>` tab was sucessful,
  the correct symmetry file name and location will be preset.
  Alternatively a external *.symm* file can be selected here.



Model evaluation
----------------

This box is used for to enable *Rosetta* to evaluate the results by the given model.

* **Use independent map for validation (half2)**:
  Enable this check box if two filtered half-maps are used.

* **Select**:
  The second *.pdb* half-map file can be selected here.



Constraints
-----------

Supply additional constraints for atom-atom distances for the *Rosetta* execution.

Sets
^^^^

* **Use constraint set from file**:
  Enables the use of an constraint file.
  An example constraint file entry would be like::

    AtomPair CA 131 CA 171  BOUNDED 0.0 5.0 1 X


* **Select**:
  Select a constraint file generated by hand or another software.
  The file suffix should be *.cst*.



Versions
--------

 The density weights database is distributed with *Rosetta* and there are various versions depending on the used *Rosetta* version.

 * **Rosetta 3.8 or below**:
   The *talaris2013* database can be used when the parameter **-restore_talaris_behavior**
   is added to the *Rosetta* command line executable as additional parameter e.g. in the *StarMap* bash template.

 * **Rosetta 3.9 or higher**:
   *ref2015* is the default.
