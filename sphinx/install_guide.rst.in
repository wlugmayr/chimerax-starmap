******************
Installation Guide
******************

.. index:: Installation

This plugin software has been developed and tested on *CentOS 7* and all features are available on Unix-based platforms.

Technically *StarMap* is pure Python-based and executed inside *ChimeraX*.

*Rosetta* is only available on Unix-based platforms like Linux and MacOSX.

On platforms where *Rosetta* is not available or installed only the execution scripts can be generated.
These must be copied to the execution platform, edited to the dedicated environment setup and can be called directly
or sent to a computing cluster using a job submission system. The analysis part of *StarMap* interacts with the Unix
shell and can therefore only be used on Unix-style systems.


.. _requirements:

Requirements
============

.. index:: ChimeraX

1. Install **ChimeraX 1.3** or newer for your operating system (:ref:`references`).

.. index:: Rosetta

2. Install the **Rosetta 3.8** or newer software for your operating system (:ref:`references`).
   The plugin has been re-tested with **Rosetta 3.13**.
   The section  :ref:`rosetta_install_help` helps in setting the correct environment for *Rosetta*.

.. index:: Perl (Optional)

3. Check if the **Perl** package of the operating system distribution is installed.
   If not use the official package installer to do it.

.. index:: PyParsing

4. The third-party **PyParsing** library is used to parse and modify the Rosetta scripts.
   This library is provided by ChimeraX.

.. index:: PyQtGraph

5. The third-party **PyQtGraph** library is used to generate and plot the result analysis graphs.
   This library is automatically installed by ChimeraX via *pip* as a dependency when you install *StarMap*.



.. _toolshed_install:

Toolshed installation
=====================

.. index:: Toolshed

1. Make sure all depency steps 1-3 in the :ref:`requirements` section are fullfilled.

2. Download *StarMap* using the *ChimeraX Toolshed*.
   In *ChimeraX* open **Tools -> More Tools...** and search the *ChimeraX* toolshed for StarMap.


.. _development_install:

Development version installation
================================

.. _linux_install:

Linux development installation
------------------------------

1.
Make sure all depency steps 1-3 in the :ref:`requirements` section are fullfilled.

2.
Make sure you use *bash* and the environment variable **CHIMERAX** is set
and the executable *ChimeraX* is in the **$PATH**
(Replace *some_dirs* with your actual directory tree) e.g.::

  export CHIMERAX=/some_dirs/ChimeraX-1.3/libexec/UCSF-ChimeraX
  export PATH=${CHIMERAX}/bin:${PATH}

3.
Install the *StarMap* distribution with one of the following lines e.g.::

  chimerax -m pip install --user ChimeraX_StarMap-@@VERSION@@-py3-none-any.whl

You can uninstall it the same way e.g.::

  chimerax -m pip uninstall ChimeraX-StarMap


.. _windows_install:

Windows native development installation
---------------------------------------

When installing *StarMap* on Windows you may have problems with spaces in directory names.

1.
Make sure the depency steps 1 and maybe 3 in the :ref:`requirements` section are fullfilled.

2.
Install the *StarMap* development version:

Go to the directory where the *StarMap* wheel file is located and call in *cmd.exe*::

  "\Program Files\ChimeraX 1.3\bin\ChimeraX-console.exe" -m pip install --user ChimeraX_StarMap-@@VERSION@@-py3-none-any.whl

You can uninstall it the same way e.g.::

  "\Program Files\ChimeraX 1.3\bin\ChimeraX-console.exe" -m pip uninstall ChimeraX_StarMap


Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) development installation
----------------------------------------------------------

On *Windows 10+* you can run *ChimeraX* in the *Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)*.

This installation is only recommended to users with deeper knowledge of Linux.
Some hints are provided in the :ref:`bash_win_howto` section.

Once the WSL setup is successful you can follow the steps in the :ref:`linux_install`.


.. _macos_install:

MacOS development installation
------------------------------

1.
Make sure the depency steps 1 and maybe 3 in the :ref:`requirements` section are fullfilled.

2.
Install the *StarMap* development version:

Go to the directory where the *StarMap* wheel file is located and call::

  /Applications/ChimeraX-1.3.app/Contents/bin/ChimeraX -m pip install --user ChimeraX_StarMap-@@VERSION@@-py3-none-any.whl

You can uninstall it the same way e.g.::

  /Applications/ChimeraX-1.3.app/Contents/bin/ChimeraX -m pip uninstall ChimeraX_StarMap



.. _test_install:

Testing the installation
========================

1.
*(Optional)* You can test the detected environment and the location of e.g. the *Rosetta* executables from the Linux *Bash* commandline like::

  chimerax -m chimerax.starmap.config

This should print you the current configuration with the full path to the Rosetta executables in the terminal window.

2.
Start *ChimeraX* and go to the menu **Tools -> Volume Data -> StarMap**. The *StarMap* user interface should appear.

In the *ChimeraX* commandline type::

  stmconfig

This should print you the current configuration with the full path to the *Rosetta* executables in the *ChimeraX* log window.
Otherwise the default GNU/Linux binary naming convention of the *Rosetta* executables will be used.
*StarMap* tries to detect the location of the executables in the **system path** using the Unix *which* command.
