StarMap is an easy-to-be-used mediator between the popular structural display program ChimeraX and the refinement program Rosetta.
StarMap provides a graphical interface within ChimeraX to control and execute Rosetta-based refinements. It includes options for symmetry,
local refinements, as well as independent map validation.

A series of analytical outputs, including precise magnification calibration (pixel size calibration) and Fourier shell correlations (FSC)
to assess the overall quality of the refinement and resolution (map versus model FSC) are being calculated.
Furthermore, per-residue Z-scores provide a fast guide to evaluate and improve local refinements as well as to identify flexible and
potentially functional sites in large macromolecular complexes.
